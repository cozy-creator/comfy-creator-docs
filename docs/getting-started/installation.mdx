## Installation

First, you'll need [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later.

Optionally we recommend that you create a virtual environment first; this isolates cozy-creator's dependencies from your system-wide Python installations:

1. Create a new virtual environment anywhere on your system:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   <Tabs>
     <TabList>
       <Tab>Windows</Tab>
       <Tab>macOS and Linux</Tab>
     </TabList>
     <TabPanels>
       <TabPanel>
         <pre><code>venv\Scripts\activate</code></pre>
       </TabPanel>
       <TabPanel>
         <pre><code>source venv/bin/activate</code></pre>
       </TabPanel>
     </TabPanels>
   </Tabs>

3. Your terminal prompt should now show the name of your virtual environment, indicating it's active.

We recommend that you have a GPU available on your system as well; Nvidia GPUs (CUDA) and Apple Silicon (MPS) are both supported. AMD GPU (ROCm) support is not guaranteed.

Next, install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) into your virtual environment. Always use a GPU-enabled version of PyTorch when possible:

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Windows and Linux</Tab>
    <Tab>macOS</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>
      <pre><code>pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124</code></pre>
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      <pre><code>pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio</code></pre>
    </TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

Finally, run:

``` 
pip install cozy-creator
```

This will install our latest release of cozy-creator from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/cozy-creator/), along with all of its dependencies into your virtual environment.

### Installing From Source

Installing from source is useful if you're modifying the source code of cozy-creator, or if you want to use a version of cozy-creator that is not yet released.

You'll need a JavaScript package manager installed on your system; we recommend [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), but [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) are also supported.

Make sure you have the source-code available:

```
git clone https://github.com/cozy-creator/gen-server.git
```

Then navigate to the `python_packages` folder. In order to install the gen-server and all plugins, run:

```
pip install -e .[plugins]
```

Or, to install the gen-server only:

```
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag is optional; it makes the installation "editable" in the sense that any changes to the source code will be used the next time you run it, without needing to reinstall.

### Explanation of the Build Process

Cozy Creator uses [Hatchling](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) as the build-backend, along with a custom build-script. The Python installation proceeds as normal:

- When doing a regular installation, the python source-code will be copied into `venv/Lib/site-packages/<package-name>` and will be used every time `cozy run` happens.

- When doing an editable installation, pip places a `direct_url.json` file inside of the `site-packages` folder, which points to the original python-script files, rather than copying them. This is why any modifications to these files will be reflected the next time you run `cozy run`.

We also build the CLI and webserver from source, using Golang:

- If Golang is installed on your system, we will build a binary for your system from the Golang module `cozy-creator/gen-server` source code (located at root of the repo).

- If Golang is not installed on your system, we will download the latest pre-built binary for your system from the [gen-server releases page](https://github.com/cozy-creator/gen-server/releases) and use that instead.

We'll place this executable binary into your venv's `bin` folder, so that it is now in your system's PATH and can be used with the keyword `cozy`. The cozy-CLI tool is used to download models and start the gen-server.

- We also use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle the react components located in your `/web` folder. This creates a `/web/dist` folder containing the transpiled, minified, and bundled JavaScript files, which will be served by the webserver. This step requires a JavaScript package manager installed on your system.

If you want to edit the frontend without having to reinstall every time, you can navigate to the `/web` folder and run:

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>yarn</Tab>
    <Tab>npm</Tab>
    <Tab>pnpm</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>
      <pre><code>yarn build</code></pre>
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      <pre><code>npm build</code></pre>
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      <pre><code>pnpm build</code></pre>
    </TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

This will bundle your changes into the `/web/dist` folder, which will be served by the web-server the next time you run `cozy run`.


### Installing Plugins

Cozy Creator plugins can be installed like any other Python package:

```
pip install <plugin-name>
```

This will install the plugin into your virtual environment; Cozy-Creator will automatically discover and load this plugin when you install cozy-creator (we use a custom post-install script), or when you run `cozy build` (which manually triggers the same post-install script).
