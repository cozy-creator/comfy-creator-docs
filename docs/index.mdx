## Cozy Creator

Cozy Creator is a complete rebuild of ComfyUI. We want to make ComfyUI simpler for end-users to work with. Cozy's node system was designed around higher-level abstractions with good defaults, resulting in less complex workflows and less need for expert-knowledge.

We also want to make it easier for dev-ops engineers to deploy and scale their workflows, without having to write custom wrappers around ComfyUI.

We also want to move AI-researchers toward industry-standard tools, by building on top of [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), the standardized library for AI-media-generation, and [HF-Model-Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-the-hub), the standardized state-dict repo. Diffusers finally has a good GUI now!
